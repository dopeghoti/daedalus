Daedalus - a Space Station 13 fork

Daedalus is an attempt to make something of the mess that is the current
generation of Space Station 13 code.  It is a fork of Baystation 12's
codebase, which is itself a fork of /tg/station 13, which is itself based
on the code of Goon Station 13, which itself was descended from the 
original, posted by someone going by the pseudonym "Exadv1" on BYOND.
(Yeah, the lineage is complicated).
