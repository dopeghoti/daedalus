Things that Need Doing:

IMMEDIATE

- baystation12/etc. -> daedalus everywhere (constified for strings)
- plasma -> thoron everywhere (constified for strings)
- randomFilename_and Variablenameformats -> lowercase_underscore everywhere

ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS IMMEDIATE

- remove any hard-coding of file locations et al., or abstract to config files
- remove inherited configurations (e. g. admins) from config/
- fix any and all typos you come across on other work
- remove things that exist only to annoy
   - clown gear
   - mime gear
   - offensive .oggs, text, code, etc.
- systematically seek out and remove all instances of the abominable 'datums'
   - replace with 'data' or 'datum' as apropos
- NSS Exodus -> NSS Icarus (incorporate Wojo's new graphic in the map)

LONGER-TERM

- make the UI less exquisitely horrible
- make the game less "an atmospheric simulation with other stuff"
- switch from MySQL to SQLite
